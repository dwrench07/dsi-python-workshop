    Keys and values are separated by a colon and a space.

    This is sorted version of dict_to_str().

    Keys and values are separated by a colon and a space.

def dict_difference(d1, d2):
    """Combine two dictionaries according to a specified set of rules.

    Combine the two dictionaries, d1 and d2, as follows:
        1. The keys are the union of the keys from each dictionary.
        2. If a key is in both dictionaries, then the value for that
           key should be the absolute value of the difference between
           the two values for that key.
        3. If a key is only in one dictionary, the value should be the
           absolute value of that value for that key.

    Parameters
    ----------
    d1 : dict
    d2 : dict

    Returns
    -------
