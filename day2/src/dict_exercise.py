    Return a str containing each key and value in dict d. Keys and values are
    separated by a colon and a space. Each key-value pair is sorted in ascending order by key.
    This is sorted version of dict_to_str().

    Note: This one is also doable in one line!

    Combine the two dictionaries, d1 and d2 as follows. The keys are the union of the keys
    from each dictionary. If the keys are in both dictionaries then the values should be the
    absolute value of the difference between the two values. If a value is only in one dictionary, the
    value should be the absolute value of that value.
